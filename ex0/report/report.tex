\section{Classification Dataset: Email-Spam}
We have chosen a Emai-Spam Dataset for classification (\href{https://www.kaggle.com/nitishabharathi/email-spam-dataset?select=enronSpamSubset.csv}{link to dataset}). The goal for this dataset is to distinguish by a machine learning algorithm between  spam and non-spam emails. The datasets are given in \texttt{csv} format and the structure is shown in table~\ref{tab::0}. Here we see that the dataset has a Body-column that contains the text-body of an email and a Label-column that is either set to 1 for spam E-mails or 0 for non-spam E-mails. 

\begin{figure}[h]

The dataset contains in total 10.000 samples where 50\% of the samples are spam- and 50\% are non-spam E-mails. Since there are no missing values the dataset is perfectly balanced with respect to the target attribute. We aim to apply the \textbf{Bag of Words} method to the dataset. This Method extracts the $N$ most common Words from all E-mails and then maps an E-mail to a vector $v$ such that the component $m$ of $v$ is an nonegative integer that counts the occureces of the $m$th most common word in the corresponding E-mail. From that we conclude that the dimension of our dataset is $N+1$ since we also include the target attribute.  Note that we apply the following cleanup steps to all Emails to remove data that we expect to not improve the classification: 1. remove links, 2. remove characters except alphabetical ones, 3.convert uppercase-chars into lowercase-chars, 3. lemmatize words 4. remove stopwords. By that we reduce the number of total different words in all e-mails from 86733 words to 74618 words by the cleanup step. This also illustrates that our classification algorithm has to work with data that is hight dimensional (dimension much larger than 1000).          
In figure~\ref{fig::word-counts} we show the most common words in spam and non-spam emails. One can see that the word count in spam e-mails is much higher than in the non-spam e-mails which means that overall spam mails have more words in common than non-spam e-mails.

\section{Regression Dataset: Automobile}
The automobile dataset is used for regression. It consists of 26 attributes shown in Table~\ref{tab::2}.
